Once you have solved this exercise, equip the main function of A Graphical Editor,Revis
ited with a clause for mouse clicks. As you experiment with moving the cursor viamouse 
clicks, you will notice that it does not exactly behave like applications that youuse o
n your other devices—even though split passes all its tests.Graphical programs, like ed
itors, call for experimentation to come up with best “look andfeel” experiences. In thi
s case, your editor is too simplistic with its placement of thecursor. After the applic
ations on your computer determine the split point, they alsodetermine which letter divi
sion is closer to the x-coordinate and place the cursor there.Exercise 512. Many operat
ing systems come with the fmt program, which can re-arrangethe words in a file so that 
all lines in the resulting file have a maximal width. As a widelyused program, fmt supp
orts a range of related functions. This exercise focuses on its corefunctionality.Desig
n the program fmt. It consumes a natural number w, the name of an input file in-f,and t
he name of an output file out-f—in the same sense as read-file from the 2htdp/batch-iol
ibrary. Its purpose is to read all the words from the in-f, to arrange these words in t
hegiven order into lines of maximal width w, and to write these lines to out-f.
