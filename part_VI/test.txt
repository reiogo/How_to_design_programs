Once you have solved this exercise, equip the main function of A Graphical Editor,
Revisited with a clause for mouse clicks. As you experiment with moving the cursor via
mouse clicks, you will notice that it does not exactly behave like applications that you
use on your other devices—even though split passes all its tests.
Graphical programs, like editors, call for experimentation to come up with best “look and
feel” experiences. In this case, your editor is too simplistic with its placement of the
cursor. After the applications on your computer determine the split point, they also
determine which letter division is closer to the x-coordinate and place the cursor there.
Exercise 512. Many operating systems come with the fmt program, which can re-arrange
the words in a file so that all lines in the resulting file have a maximal width. As a widely
used program, fmt supports a range of related functions. This exercise focuses on its core
functionality.
Design the program fmt. It consumes a natural number w, the name of an input file in-f,
and the name of an output file out-f—in the same sense as read-file from the 2htdp/batch-io
library. Its purpose is to read all the words from the in-f, to arrange these words in the
given order into lines of maximal width w, and to write these lines to out-f.
