# Program Design (HtDP Solutions)

This repository contains my **complete solutions** to *[How to Design Programs (2nd Edition)](https://htdp.org/)* by Felleisen, Findler, Flatt, and Krishnamurthi â€”  
the textbook used to teach first-year Computer Science students at **Northeastern University** how to design programs systematically.

## Why This Matters
*How to Design Programs* is not just a programming book â€” it's a training manual for **thinking like a computer scientist**.  
It teaches a repeatable, rigorous process for:
- Analyzing problems
- Designing data representations
- Writing clear, correct programs
- Testing systematically

## My Approach
I am working through **every single exercise** in the book, focusing on:
- âœ… **Tests for every program** â€” using the book's design recipe
- âœ… **Clear definitions and naming** â€” for readability and maintainability
- âœ… **Step-by-step clarity** â€” documenting the reasoning process

> My goal is to build a foundation for correct, maintainable, and scalable software â€” a skill that applies directly to systems programming, distributed systems, and high-performance engineering.

## Structure
Solutions are organized by **Part Iâ€“VI** of the textbook:
- **Part I:** Fixed-size data
- **Part II:** Arbitrarily large data
- **Part III:** Abstraction
- **Part IV:** Intertwined data
- **Part V:** Generative recursion
- **Part VI** accumulators

## Highlights
Here are a few representative solutions:
- [Lamda Functions and Abstractions](./part_III/lambda/identity-matrix.rkt)  
- [Intertwined Data Definitions](./part_IV/s-expressions/directory_functions.rkt)  

Each example demonstrates **tests, systematic design, and clear documentation**.
