## August 20, 2025 â€” The Lambda Breakthrough

I just wrote a function that produces a identity matrix using the build-list abstraction and lambdas.
It was like playing an instrument and suddenly my hands just *know* where to go.
This is intuition! This is fluency.

I want to savor this moment.

(define (identity-matrix n)
  (build-list
   n
   (lambda (n0)
     (build-list
      n
      (lambda (n1) (if (= n1 n0) 1 0))))))
